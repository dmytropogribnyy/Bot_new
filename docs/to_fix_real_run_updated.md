Revised Plan to Include All Fixes
To ensure all issues are covered, this plan incorporates the fixes applied so far and outlines the remaining steps for a full REAL_RUN test. The bot is now in a stable state, with several critical issues resolved. The plan focuses on REAL_RUN safe mode (DRY_RUN = False, RISK_PERCENT = 0.005, MAX_POSITIONS = 3, SYMBOLS_ACTIVE = ["BTC/USDC", "ETH/USDC"]), with bot-driven position opening (no manual orders). Each step includes:

Short description.

Safe Mode Settings

# config.py

DRY_RUN = False
RISK_PERCENT = 0.005
MAX_POSITIONS = 3
SYMBOLS_ACTIVE = ["BTC/USDC", "ETH/USDC"]
LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
MAX_OPEN_ORDERS = 10

Temporary Testing Settings:For the current REAL_RUN test, we are intentionally using temporary settings in config.py to simplify testing and increase trade frequency:

MAX_POSITIONS = 1 (instead of 3) to focus on a single trade for debugging.
RISK_PERCENT = 0.0001 (instead of 0.005) to minimize risk during testing.
MAX_OPEN_ORDERS = 3 (instead of 10) to test order management with a lower limit.
SYMBOLS_ACTIVE includes 10 symbols (instead of 2) to increase the likelihood of trades being opened.

These temporary settings will be reverted to the safe mode values above after the current test is complete and issues are resolved.
Backup
Save codebase and tp_performance.csv to data/backups.
Testing Notes

Run bot for 15-30 minutes per step, or longer (1 hour) for a final comprehensive test.
Use ~120 USDC balance (current balance: 116.93252203 USDC as of 2025-04-24 12:58:26).
Bot opens positions automatically.
Close positions with /stop or /panic YES.
Check telegram_log.txt and tp_performance.csv.
Stop bot after each test (Ctrl+C or /stop).
Use /panic YES to clear positions before each step.

Revised Step-by-Step Plan
Step 1: Clean tp_performance.csv to Fix Parsing Error
Description: [ERROR] Failed to calculate trades per day: time data "# testing line" doesn't match format... occurs due to a malformed line in tp_performance.csv. Clean the file to ensure proper logging and parsing.
File:

tp_performance.csv

Apply:

Open tp_performance.csv and remove the line # testing line.
Ensure the file follows the format: Date,Symbol,Side,....

Test:

Use /panic YES to close all positions.
Start bot: cd c:/Bots/BinanceBot && python main.py.
Wait for bot to open and close a position (allow trades to execute without issuing /stop immediately).
Check telegram_log.txt for no [ERROR] Failed to calculate trades per day.
Verify tp_performance.csv updates with new trade records.
Close positions with /stop, recheck tp_performance.csv.

Check Error:

Fixed: No parsing errors, tp_performance.csv updates correctly.
Not Fixed: Parsing errors persist (e.g., [ERROR] Failed to calculate trades per day).

Status: Fixed. The malformed line was removed, and the latest run (2025-04-24) logged trades without parsing errors:
2025-04-24 12:57:34,XRP/USDC,BUY,2.1542,2.1581,5.43,False,False,False,0.18,SOFT_EXIT,10,False,0.0,0.0,0.0

Step 2: Retest MAX_POSITIONS Limit, tp_performance.csv Updates, MAX_OPEN_ORDERS, Margin Check, Break-Even, and SmartSwitch
Description: Retest previously applied fixes in a single comprehensive run where trades are opened and closed:

MAX_POSITIONS (≤3), MAX_OPEN_ORDERS (≤10), and tp_performance.csv updates (Step 1).
Margin insufficient error fix (Step 2).
Break-even decimal.ConversionSyntax fix (Step 5).
SmartSwitch 'ResultType' error fix (Step 6).
tp_performance.csv duplication and Result field fix (new issue).

Files:

main.py (ID: 85e5435f-adf6-4548-9b10-fcefc4bfc4cf)
trade_engine.py (ID: cf1c1507-e84d-4d74-a6ac-594cd7fcd4c4, includes MAX_OPEN_ORDERS, break-even, trailing stop, record_trade_result fixes, and MIN_NOTIONAL imports)
tp_logger.py (ID: f9a64633-e0ce-4d9f-bad8-2a59781f9967, includes SOFT_EXIT logging fix)
config.py (ID: 64a58f50-0947-4c66-a868-44a6e8ffdf31, modified for MAX_OPEN_ORDERS and MIN_NOTIONAL constants)
symbol_processor.py (ID: fe2828c8, includes margin fix)
engine_controller.py (ID: 3b8971ba-c09f-4caf-96e7-e8f9f2c72a1b, includes SmartSwitch fix)

Apply:

Replace main.py, trade_engine.py, tp_logger.py, symbol_processor.py, and engine_controller.py with artifacts.
Use current config.py with temporary settings for this test:
MAX_POSITIONS = 1
RISK_PERCENT = 0.0001
MAX_OPEN_ORDERS = 3
SYMBOLS_ACTIVE with 10 symbols.

Updated config.py to define MIN_NOTIONAL_OPEN and MIN_NOTIONAL_ORDER, and updated trade_engine.py to import these constants.

Test:

Use /panic YES to close all positions.
Start bot: cd c:/Bots/BinanceBot && python main.py.
Wait for bot to open a position (limited to 1 due to temporary MAX_POSITIONS = 1). Avoid issuing /stop immediately to allow trades to execute.
Allow the position to run for 15-30 minutes to trigger break-even, SmartSwitch, and TP/SL orders.
Check telegram_log.txt for:
[Skipping {symbol} — max open positions (1) reached] for 2nd position attempt.
[TP/SL] Skipping TP/SL for {symbol} — max open orders (3) reached] if applicable.
[REAL_RUN] Logged TP result for {symbol} for trade closures.
[Skipping {symbol} — insufficient margin (required: X, available: Y)] if margin check triggers.
[DEBUG] Creating break-even for {symbol} without [ERROR] create_break_even ... decimal.ConversionSyntax.
[SmartSwitch] Closed without [SmartSwitch] Failed ... 'ResultType'.

If the position doesn’t close naturally within 30 minutes, close it with /panic YES to retest the command’s functionality (preferred, since it failed previously), or use /stop as an alternative.
Verify on Binance: ≤1 position, ≤3 open orders per symbol.
Confirm tp_performance.csv has new records for opened and closed trades, with correct Result (e.g., SOFT_EXIT) and no duplicates. Do not clear tp_performance.csv again, as it was already cleaned in Step 1.

Check Errors:

MAX_POSITIONS Fixed: ≤1 position open (due to temporary setting); 2nd attempt logs [Skipping ... max open positions (1)].
MAX_OPEN_ORDERS Fixed: ≤3 open orders per symbol (due to temporary setting); excess logs [Skipping TP/SL ... max open orders].
Logging Fixed: tp_performance.csv has trade records, no duplicates, Result field correct.
Margin Fixed: No [ERROR] create_limit_order TP1 ... Margin is insufficient.
Break-Even Fixed: Break-even orders set, no type errors.
SmartSwitch Fixed: No ResultType errors, SmartSwitch closures logged.
Not Fixed: If any of the above errors persist (e.g., >1 position, margin errors, break-even errors, SmartSwitch errors, incorrect Result).

Status: In Progress. REAL_RUN restarted on 2025-04-24 after updating MIN_NOTIONAL constants, and restarted again on 2025-04-25 to ensure consistency. Currently waiting for trades to open and close to test:

MAX_POSITIONS limit (≤1 due to temporary setting).
MAX_OPEN_ORDERS limit (≤3 due to temporary setting).
Margin checks (no notional errors).
Break-Even functionality (no errors).
SmartSwitch closures (no errors).
tp_performance.csv logging (correct Result, no duplicates).Latest run (2025-04-24) opened an XRP/USDC trade, closed via soft exit, and logged correctly with SOFT_EXIT, but /panic YES failed to clear the state, indicating an issue with order cancellation. Awaiting results of the current run to confirm all fixes.

Artifacts:

config.py (ID: 64a58f50-0947-4c66-a868-44a6e8ffdf31)

symbol_processor.py (ID: fe2828c8)
engine_controller.py (ID: 3b8971ba-c09f-4caf-96e7-e8f9f2c72a1b)

Step 3: Retest /stop and /panic YES Commands, Trailing Stop, and Graceful Shutdown
Description: Retest fixes that were confirmed in previous runs but need validation with open trades:

/stop and /panic YES commands (Step 3).
Trailing stop fix (Step 4).
Graceful shutdown (Step 8).

Files:

telegram_commands.py (ID: 23825497-8163-4cc0-8bde-94fbb7b9cdc7)
trade_engine.py (ID: cf1c1507-e84d-4d74-a6ac-594cd7fcd4c4, includes trailing stop fix)
main.py (ID: 85e5435f-adf6-4548-9b10-fcefc4bfc4cf, includes graceful shutdown fix)

Apply:

Replace telegram_commands.py with artifact.
Use trade_engine.py and main.py from Step 2 (already include fixes).
After Step 2 testing is complete, update config.py to revert temporary settings to safe mode values:
MAX_POSITIONS = 3
RISK_PERCENT = 0.005
MAX_OPEN_ORDERS = 10
SYMBOLS_ACTIVE = ["BTC/USDC", "ETH/USDC"]

Test:

Use /panic YES to close positions.
Start bot.
Wait for bot to open 1-2 positions.
Allow positions to run for 15-30 minutes to trigger trailing stop.
Send /stop or /panic YES.
Check telegram_log.txt for:
[Stop] Closing position or [Panic] Closing position.
[WARNING] Insufficient data for trailing stop (fallback used) if applicable, no [ERROR] Trailing init fallback: index 14 is out of bounds.

Stop with Ctrl+C.
Check telegram_log.txt for [Main] Bot manually stopped via console (Ctrl+C) and no new trade entries after this.
Verify on Binance: all positions closed, no new positions after Ctrl+C.
Confirm tp_performance.csv logs closures.

Check Errors:

/stop and /panic YES Fixed: Positions close, logs show ✅ All trades closed.
Trailing Stop Fixed: No index errors, fallback used or closure logged.
Graceful Shutdown Fixed: No trades opened after Ctrl+C, log confirms stop.
Not Fixed: Positions remain, index errors, or trades opened after Ctrl+C.

Status: Pending. Awaiting results of Step 2 REAL_RUN to proceed with testing /stop, /panic YES, trailing stop, and graceful shutdown with open trades. Previous runs confirmed /stop prevented new trades, but closure wasn’t tested with open positions. Trailing stop and graceful shutdown were confirmed earlier but need retesting in the context of a full run.
Step 4: Comprehensive REAL_RUN Test
Description: Run the bot for 1 hour with all fixes applied to ensure stability, logging, and error-free operation.
Files:

Use all updated files from previous steps.

Apply:

Confirm all files are updated (main.py, trade_engine.py, telegram_commands.py, symbol_processor.py, engine_controller.py, tp_logger.py).
Confirm config.py settings are reverted to safe mode values (after Step 2 testing).

Test:

Use /panic YES to close positions.
Start bot.
Run for 1 hour, allowing bot to open and close positions.
Monitor telegram_log.txt for:
Trade openings and closures.
Break-even, SmartSwitch, and trailing stop triggers.
No errors (margin, break-even, SmartSwitch, parsing, etc.).

Use /stop and /panic YES to test closure.
Stop with Ctrl+C to test shutdown.
Verify on Binance: positions managed correctly, no unexpected orders.
Confirm tp_performance.csv logs all trades accurately.

Check Errors:

Fixed: All fixes work together, no errors, trades logged correctly.
Not Fixed: Any errors (margin, break-even, SmartSwitch, parsing, shutdown issues).

Status: Pending. Will proceed after Steps 2 and 3 are confirmed successful.
Implementation Workflow
Prep:

Backup codebase and tp_performance.csv.
Update config.py with temporary settings for Step 2 testing.
Use /panic YES to clear positions.
Clean tp_performance.csv (Step 1).

Apply Fixes:

Replace files with artifacts per step.
Run bot: cd c:/Bots/BinanceBot && python main.py.
Test as described, checking telegram_log.txt and tp_performance.csv.
Stop bot after each test (Ctrl+C or /stop).

Monitor:

Share telegram_log.txt if errors persist.
Proceed to next step after fixing current error.

Final Check:

Run bot for 1 hour after all fixes (Step 4).
Verify tp_performance.csv logs all trades, no errors in logs.

Confirmation
The revised plan includes all fixes applied so far:

Balance Fix (Step 7): Confirmed in the latest run (2025-04-24) as 116.93252203 USDC.
Trailing Stop Fix (Step 4): Not tested in the latest run, but previously fixed (2025-04-18).
Graceful Shutdown Fix (Step 8): Confirmed in the latest run (no trades after /shutdown).
Redundant Balance Log Removed (Step 7): Confirmed in the latest run.
MAX_POSITIONS and /stop (Steps 1 and 3): Confirmed in the latest run (prevented trades in stopping state).
tp_performance.csv Parsing Fix (Step 1): Fixed by cleaning the file.
tp_performance.csv Duplication and Result Field Fix: Fixed with trade_closed flag and result_type updates.
MIN_NOTIONAL Constants: Updated to define MIN_NOTIONAL_OPEN and MIN_NOTIONAL_ORDER in config.py for consistency.

Remaining issues (margin check, break-even, SmartSwitch, /panic YES failure) are being tested in the current REAL_RUN (Step 2). Step 3 will retest /stop, /panic YES, trailing stop, and graceful shutdown. Step 4 ensures all fixes work together.
Observations from Latest Run (2025-04-24)

XRP/USDC Trade: Opened and closed via soft exit, logged correctly with SOFT_EXIT in tp_performance.csv:2025-04-24 12:57:34,XRP/USDC,BUY,2.1542,2.1581,5.43,False,False,False,0.18,SOFT_EXIT,10,False,0.0,0.0,0.0

/panic YES Failure: Despite the fix, /panic YES failed to clear the state, as the bot still thought there was an open position:[2025-04-24 12:59:16] [INFO] [Main] Max open positions (1) reached. Active: 1. Skipping cycle...

This indicates an issue with order cancellation or state synchronization with Binance.
Notional Errors: Encountered notional errors for BTC/USDC, ETH/USDC, and XRP/USDC TP2 orders, indicating the position size adjustment fix needs validation.
Break-Even Error: Still present:[2025-04-24 12:54:56] [ERROR] [ERROR] Break-even error for XRP/USDC: 'XRP/USDC'

Next Steps

Await Results of Step 2 REAL_RUN: Restarted on 2025-04-25 after updating MIN_NOTIONAL constants. Monitor for 15-30 minutes to confirm:
MAX_POSITIONS and MAX_OPEN_ORDERS limits (using temporary settings).
Margin checks (no notional errors).
Break-Even functionality (no errors).
SmartSwitch closures (no errors).
tp_performance.csv logging (correct Result, no duplicates).

Address /panic YES Failure: Investigate why /panic YES didn’t clear the state, likely due to open orders not being canceled properly.
Address Notional Errors: Validate the position size adjustment fix in enter_trade.
Address Break-Even Error: Fix the remaining break-even error.
Revert config.py Settings: After Step 2 testing, revert temporary settings in config.py to safe mode values:
MAX_POSITIONS = 3
RISK_PERCENT = 0.005
MAX_OPEN_ORDERS = 10
SYMBOLS_ACTIVE = ["BTC/USDC", "ETH/USDC"]

Proceed to Step 3: After confirming Step 2 results, test /stop, /panic YES, trailing stop, and graceful shutdown.
Share Results: Provide telegram_log.txt and tp_performance.csv after the current run to confirm fixes and identify any remaining issues.

Symbol Limit Recommendation
Currently using 10 symbols in SYMBOLS_ACTIVE for testing to increase trade frequency, which is appropriate for the current REAL_RUN. Will revert to 2 symbols (BTC/USDC, ETH/USDC) as per safe mode settings after Step 2 testing.
Ready to await Step 2 results? Share telegram_log.txt and tp_performance.csv after the run to proceed with analysis and fixes. 😊
