Implementation Details
Day 1: Configuration Foundation

Update config_loader.py with PRIORITY_SMALL_BALANCE_PAIRS
Add adaptive risk functions (get_adaptive_risk_percent(), etc.)
Configure minimum TP/SL values (0.7/1.3/1.0%)
Set up margin safety buffer (90%)
Run ruff check --fix . to clean import errors

Day 2: Algorithm Enhancements

Implement ATR-based TP/SL calculation with minimums
Add market regime detection (flat/trend/neutral)
Set up commission calculation for accurate profit tracking
Configure absolute profit calculation in USDC
Implement priority pair filtering logic

Day 3: Core Validation & Safety

Add NoneType validation throughout symbol_processor.py
Implement 90% margin buffer in position calculation
Set up unique trade ID generation with verification
Configure risk percentage scaling (2-4%)
Implement minimum profit validation (0.15-0.5 USDC)

Day 4: Command & Control Improvements

Enhance /stop command with position monitoring
Fix /panic implementation with verification
Add /restart functionality
Improve status reporting with balance/risk display
Configure maximum position limits by account size

Day 5-7: Testing & Deployment

Run accelerated 3-hour stress test with full simulation
Verify duplicate prevention in trade logging
Test all Telegram commands for reliability
Analyze win rate and commission impact
Launch with XRP/USDC and DOGE/USDC only
Monitor initial 5-10 trades before expanding
Progressively increase risk (1.5% → 2% → 2.5%)

Optimal Settings for 100-120 USDC Account
Risk Management

Risk: Start with 1.5%, quickly move to 2% after 5 successful trades
Maximum positions: 2 initially, expand to 3 after proven profitability
Leverage: 5x for BTC/ETH, 10x for small price pairs (XRP/DOGE/ADA)
Margin buffer: 90% to prevent "insufficient margin" errors

Trading Pairs

Initial focus: XRP/USDC, DOGE/USDC only
Secondary expansion: ADA/USDC, SOL/USDC
Limit active pairs to 4 maximum for small accounts
Use dynamic volatility filtering for pair selection

TP/SL Strategy

TP1: max(1.0×ATR, 0.7%) with 70% position size
TP2: max(2.0×ATR, 1.3%) with 30% position size
SL: max(1.5×ATR, 1.0%)
Break-even: Move to entry after 50% of distance to TP1

Minimum Requirements

Minimum net profit: 0.15-0.2 USDC after commissions
Risk/reward ratio: At least 1:1.5 (higher for weaker signals)
Maximum commission impact: 25% of gross profit

Daily Performance Monitoring

Track absolute profit in USDC (primary KPI for small accounts)
Monitor commission percentage of total profit
Track win rate with aim for 60%+
Report daily statistics via Telegram at end of day

This accelerated implementation plan compresses what would normally be a 2-3 week process into 7 days, allowing for faster verification of the trading strategy with small deposits.
