# Archive Policy

This directory contains archived modules and tooling that are no longer part of the active runtime.

- See detailed policy and migration guidance in `docs/ARCHIVE_README.md`.
- Archived code must not be imported from runtime modules.
- Keep history intact; do not delete code without a prior backup.
